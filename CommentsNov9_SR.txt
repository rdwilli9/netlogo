About the model:

Comments:
1. I ordered the code to improve its readability.
2. I included some descriptions on the procedures. There is also work to do on that.
3. I separated the debt between farmers and co-farmers
4. I created a slider called coop-benefit which affects the co-farmers debt (a benefit to be part of the co-op).
5. I added the variable “reputation” instead influence. Reputation is something given and could be a function of other variables (thing to explore), while “influence” is about the capacity of one agent to spread the message through links. Consequently, I added a reporter called “influence” which count the number of links of co-producers.
6. I redefined the local variable called “power”. The power of a co-farmer is given by its reputation minus his debt. You can have a good reputation but if you are in debt, your power won’t be enough.
7. I added a variable called “identity” using a random-float between 0 and 0.3. This variable define something like kins of turtles. Then I added and option on the code (to join procedure) to include, if we want, a homophily condition on the recruitment of green turtles (based on the kin).
8. I added also a procedure to resize blue turtles based on their reputation and influence (which is a reporter as I told above).
9. I added a plot with the number of links per tick.
10. I added a histogram with the size (a function of “reputation” plus “influence).

Ideas and thoughts

1. Maybe we should explore the normalization of variable values (when that should be pertinent) as a way to deal with the asymmetries in the model.
2. Definition of time units is needed.
3. In the (;;) comments should be useful to describe and explain values and operations between values (is not complete).
4. Maybe we should explore more the idea of affect through reporters some variables (like “reputation”).

Cheers,
Sebastián
